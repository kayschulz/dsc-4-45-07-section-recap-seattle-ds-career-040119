    "* Word Embeddings are a type of vectorization strategy that computes word vectors from a text corpus\n",
    "* Word embeddings use similarity metrics, which can reveal how certain words relate to each other, or \"semantic relationships\"\n",
    "* Unlike TF-IDF vectorization, the size of word embeddings is a tunable parameter, which can help overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "* Word Embeddings can be created using so-called \"Word2Vec\" models that are given enough training data\n",
    "* Deep learning is used to create Word2Vec models, and the idea is that given a certain context, the model should be able to generate the next most plausible word in the sequence\n",
    "* Training Word Embeddings can be really time consuming, and when building a predictive model you'd want to avoid spending a lot of time here. Pretrained Word Vectors are very useful here, and GLoVe is the most commoly used model\n",
    "* When using GLoVe, and moving towards a vector representation for any arbitrarily-sized block of text, Mean Word Embeddings can be used\n",
    "* scikit-learn pipelines can be used to create Mean Word Embeddings"
